# Google Analytics API for Service Accounts with PhP

This project was developed for the company I work at. I needed to get some data from Google Analytics and show it on our dashboard.
The way I developed it I can get data from any start of URL from any date range you set on the code. 

For example, if you want all results with an URL that start with /news in a 7 days range, just change on the code and it will get all fo this data for you and put it in a google column chart.

I hope it helps someone. Thanks, if anyone got any doubt let me know.

Thanks Guys!
